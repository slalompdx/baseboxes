== HOW TO USE ==

Clone repo

bundle install

BASE_BUILD=rhel-7 be rake build

== NOTE ON BOX NAMES ==

Dash count indicates level in hierarchy and thus build order -

For instance -

centos-6 <-- base build
centos-6-puppet <-- builds on this
centos-6-puppet-jenkins <-- builds on centos-6-puppet

== Proxies ==
Call packer with -var and then http_proxy and https_proxy (and their capitalized counterparts if you like) to build boxes with proxies.

== Environment variables ==

HTTP_PROXY
HTTPS_PROXY
NO_PROXY
BOX_BUILD - set to the name of a build to build only that box during rake spec
BOX_OVERRIDE - set to true to have rake spec avoid building each box
BOX_FORCE - rebuild packer box even if artifacts are present
